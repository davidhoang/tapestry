# Tapestry: Intelligent Design Matchmaking

Tapestry is a  [Proof of Concept](http://www.proofofconcept.pub) experiment.

Problem statement: I get reached out by a lot of people in my network asking for recommendations of designers. Though I'd like to help, this is time consuming and often results in me needing to manually go through a repository of talent.
